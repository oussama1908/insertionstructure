Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works the way we sort playing cards in our hands. Each time we take a new card we put it in the right place in our hand. 




# Insertion Sort Algorithm

This repository contains an implementation of the Insertion Sort algorithm and . The algorithm sorts an array of integers in ascending order.

   /* ASSIGNMENT OF THE INDEX FOR THE NEW NUMBER */
when we assigned a variable indexToInsert to n and its value is inferior to the first element of V1 hen it will take a place in that index inorder to do that we must streching tha V1 so that new take place in the order of the tapble respectivly.
