# InsertSort Card Algorithm

This repository contains an implementation of the Insertion Sort algorithm for sorting an array of integers, with the ability to insert new numbers while maintaining the sorted order. The algorithm is provided in both pseudo-code and as a step-by-step explanation.

## Algorithm Overview

The `InsertSort card` algorithm reads an array of integers, performs insertion sorting to sort the array in ascending order, and then allows the user to insert new numbers while keeping the array sorted.

## Pseudo-Code Algorithm

The pseudo-code algorithm of the "InsertSort card" algorithm is outlined in the file `insertSortCardAlgorithm.pseudo`. It provides a detailed explanation of the algorithm's steps, including variable declarations, loops, and insertion sorting logic.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository or download the files.
2. Study the pseudo-code algorithm in `insertSortCardAlgorithm.pseudo` for a thorough understanding of the algorithm's implementation.
3. Implement the algorithm in your preferred programming language using the provided pseudo-code as a reference.

## Example Input and Output

Upon running the algorithm, you will be prompted to enter the length of the array and the array elements. After the initial array is sorted, you can insert new numbers while maintaining the sorted order.
